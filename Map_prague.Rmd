## Summary

The goal of the project is to create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet, and to host the resulting web page on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.


## R Markdown
```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
addMarkers(lat=50.073658, lng=14.418540, popup = "Prague")

my_map
```
